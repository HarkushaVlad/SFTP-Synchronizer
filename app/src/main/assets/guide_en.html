<h1>How to Use the App</h1>

<p>This app allows you to synchronize folder states and files between your phone and an SFTP server.
    It has several key features to help you keep your directories and files up-to-date.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Detects new files and replaces older versions on either device (phone or SFTP server).</li>
    <li>Adds new files from one device to the other.</li>
    <li>Deletes files to ensure complete directory mirroring between devices.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>To synchronize folders, you need to configure the following settings:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Enter SFTP connection details in the settings.</li>
    <li>Specify the path to the desired directory on both the phone and the SFTP server. Note that
        directory names must be identical.
    </li>
    <li>For files, ensure that file names match between the two devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>For phone directory selection, you can use a graphical file picker. For SFTP paths, automatic
    path filling is available if you specify a base directory in the settings.</p>

<h2>Synchronization Process</h2>
<p>During synchronization, the app performs the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If a file needs to be replaced due to being older, you will receive a confirmation prompt to
        approve or cancel the operation, unless auto-confirm is enabled.
    </li>
    <li>File deletions will also prompt for confirmation, unless auto-confirm is enabled.</li>
    <li>New files are copied without requiring additional confirmation, as data loss is not a
        concern in this case.
    </li>
</ul>

<div class="note">
    <strong>Note:</strong>
    Deletion of files can only be detected if the directory has been scanned and its structure
    logged beforehand. If the structure was not logged, the app will not detect deleted files and
    may duplicate them if missing on the opposite platform.
</div>

<h2>Two Files Synchronization Mode</h2>
<p>This mode is used when synchronizing exactly two files instead of directories. In this mode, file
    deletion is not supported. Only file replacement and copying are available.</p>

<h2>Additional Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Auto-Confirm:</strong> Enable the auto-confirm feature to automatically accept all
        changes without prompts.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Logs:</strong> You can view synchronization logs and file operations for
        troubleshooting purposes. Access logs via the 'Settings' menu.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Configure the SFTP settings in the 'Settings' menu.</li>
    <li>Use the 'Choose' button to select the directory or file on your phone.</li>
    <li>Enter the SFTP path manually or use the 'Auto-Paste' feature to automatically fill it based
        on the base SFTP directory path specified in the settings.
    </li>
    <li>Click 'SYNCHRONIZE' to start the synchronization process.</li>
</ol>
